RRCube
=========

<a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity3D</a> game inspired by movies "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123755/" target="_blank">Cube</a>" and "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285492/" target="_blank">CubeÂ²: Hypercube</a>"<br /><br />
At the moment I have no intentions to release it as a full game and making it only to learn <a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity3D</a>.<br />
The code might be not as efficient as it could be because it is my first <a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity3D</a> project.
